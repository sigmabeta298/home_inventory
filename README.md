## A Home Inventory Project

### About

The idea is to have a home inventory system, which can help keep track of 
household groceries that are purchased and consumed. Alerts to notify when
quantiy of items goes below a preset threshold, preparation of a shopping list,
analytics of use of items are some of the features that would be built in.
The inventory will be a database.
